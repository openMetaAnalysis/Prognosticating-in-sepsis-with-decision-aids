Prognosticating in sepsis with decision aids
============================================
A living systematic review

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is or is not* effective. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I2 was '[moderate](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at XX%. This review updates the previously published meta-analysis.(1)

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that updates a previously published meta-analysis.(1) Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references. 

This repository is a limited review and contains outcomes data only without PICO and Risk of Bias Tables.  This review does not include a GRADE Profile or Summary of Findings Table.

See [methods](http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/methods.html) for details.

**Results:** Details of the studies included are in the:
* [Description of studies (PICO table)](../../tree/master/study-details/pico-table.md) (not available)
* [Risk of bias assessment](../../tree/master/study-details/risk-of-bias.md) (not available)
* [Forest plots](../../tree/master/forest-plots) ([source data](../../tree/master/data))
* [Meta-regressions](../../tree/master/metaregression) ([source data](../../tree/master/data))
* [Reconciliation of conclusions and trials included with prior meta-analyses](../../tree/master/reconcilation-tables) (not available)

The forest plot for the primary outcome is below. Additional [forest plots](../../tree/master/forest-plots) of secondary analyses may be available.
